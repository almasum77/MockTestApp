London, the capital city of the United Kingdom, is one of the world's most significant cultural, financial, and historical centers. Situated on the River Thames in the southeast of England, it has been a major settlement for two millennia, with its history stretching back to its founding by the Romans, who named it Londinium.

The city's core, the ancient City of London, retains its medieval boundaries, but since at least the 19th century, the name "London" has also referred to the metropolis surrounding this core.

London's architecture is as diverse as its culture. The cityscape is a striking juxtaposition of historical buildings like the Tower of London and modern skyscrapers such as The Shard. Architectural landmarks such as Westminster Abbey, the Royal Palace of Westminster (home to the British Parliament), and Buckingham Palace, reflect London's British royal heritage. The iconic Big Ben clock tower and the London Eye, a gigantic observation wheel on the South Bank of the Thames, offer panoramic views of the city.

Culturally, London is a city of immense creativity. It is home to the British Museum, the National Gallery, the Tate Modern, and the West End theatre district, renowned worldwide for its theatre productions. London's influence in music, fashion, and art is unrivaled, making it a city that continuously sets global trends.

Economically, London is a powerhouse with one of the largest city GDPs in the world. It is recognized as a major global financial center, with major institutions like the Bank of England, the London Stock Exchange, and numerous international banks headquartered there. The city's business dynamism helps drive the British economy but also attracts a myriad of international businesses.
